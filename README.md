What's hot? The Github Game Jam 2015! The theme is 'The Game Has Changed'.

About Floodgate Dungeon
===============================
The original game(called FloodIt) was just a simple puzzle game.

What's new? I turned the puzzle game into a infinite runner game set in a dungeon! To pass the massive floodgates you will need to solve the puzzle on the door with a certain step limit. I added a score system, a currency system to hack the gates and get more steps, and a jStorage part to save high scores.
